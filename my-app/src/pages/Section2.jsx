            The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private land-grant research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Established in 1861, MIT has since played 
            a key role in the development of modern technology and science, ranking among the top academic institutions in the world.[10][11][12][13]

            Founded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction 
            in applied science and engineering.
